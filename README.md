### Dashboard Creation
The Excel Dashboard provides an interactive overview of product performance and customer engagement. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) presented include Total Profit (likely derived from price and cost), Average Rating, and Total Reviews. The dashboard also features a High Discount Flag, allowing quick identification of heavily discounted products. All analysis results from the pivot tables are visually represented in accompanying charts, and a slicer for Product Category enables dynamic filtering and deeper exploration of category-specific insights.
